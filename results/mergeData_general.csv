implications of inadequate WasH for education cognitive development and nutrition are not fully documented and inadequate WasH is one of many deprivations suffered by the worlds poorest and most marginalized populations .,0,1,0,1

as the urban poor tend to live in concentrated and highly vulnerable areas such as river banks they are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change .,1,0,0,2
furthermore as the target also includes an element of progressively eliminating inequalities in access it would encourage policymakers to address the needs of the urban poor .,0,1,1,2
